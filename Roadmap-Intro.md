# Data Engineering Mastery Plan  
A structured, realistic routine designed for long-term growth and deep technical skill.

---

## 📅 Daily Routine (Habit Building)
**Morning — 45 minutes**  
- Read *Fundamentals of Data Engineering*  
- Rotate with engineering blogs (Netflix, Airbnb, Uber, Meta)

**Afternoon — 30 minutes**  
- Quick practice session: SQL or Python drills

**Evening — 60–90 minutes**  
- Hands-on: Databricks, Spark, Kafka, Airflow, Docker, Iceberg  
- Build or extend a real project

**Weekly Ritual**  
- 1 long deep-dive session (2–3 hours)  
- 1 review/notes session  
- 1 rest day (no tech to avoid burnout)
